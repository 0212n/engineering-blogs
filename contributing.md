# Contribution Guidelines

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- For company blogs, make sure that 80% of content is technical (posts about interesting technical challenges, lessons they've learned, etc). No PR, self-promoting posts. 
- For individual blogs, as long as posts are mostly technical (Not as strict with the ratio as the company one), I am happy to add them.
- For both companies and individuals, use the following format: `Full Name link`
- The pull request and commit should include what you added/removed.
